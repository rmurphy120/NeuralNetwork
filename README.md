<p>This was my first attempt at constructing a neural network. My knowlege consisted of <a href="https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=1rKxRGr92Uj1h1Dl">this video series</a> 
and <a href="https://youtu.be/hfMk-kjRv4c?si=m5C-Vzbfkfqf7i4z">this dev log</a>, so I was figuring a lot out on my own. Written in java, is was designed to be general 
purpose. My first task for it was to classify whether a random point was above or below a certain function on a 2-D graph. This was fairly trivial, but it allowed my to 
remove some of the complexity to test its functionality. Next, I trained it on the MNIST dataset for classifying handwritten digits, which was the ultimate goal. It 
contains reminant code from tests of different algoritms (Such as Xavier Initialization). These tests were unsuccesful, most likely because I lack some crucial understanding 
of how these algorithms function, but I left them in case I ever want to go back to them.</p>
